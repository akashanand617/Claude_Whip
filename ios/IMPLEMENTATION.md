# R02 Ring — SwiftUI implementation

Built from the design handoff in `~/design_handoff_r02_ring/` (`README.md` and
`R02 Health Dashboard.dc.html`), which stayed outside this repo.
Open `R02Ring.xcodeproj` and run the `R02Ring` scheme. Target iOS 17, portrait iPhone.

```
R02Ring/
  R02RingApp.swift        @main + RootView (tabs, nav stack)
  Design/Tokens.swift     colours, type scale, metrics
  Design/Components.swift tab bar, battery pill, toggle, rules, legend, Screen chrome
  Model/AppModel.swift    tabs, metrics, ranges, gesture map, device/user state
  Model/HealthData.swift  chart fixtures + headline copy per metric × range
  Screens/                Today, the three detail screens, Gestures, Settings
  Hand/                   the procedural 3D hand renderer
```

## Which Today screen

The handoff's file list points at `1a`/`1c` for Today, but neither is in the shipped
vocabulary — `1a` is light iOS cards and `1c` is a warm editorial layout, both from the
first exploration turn. **`5a` (Today — dark, Health mode) is what's built here.** It is
the newest Today on the canvas, it is the only one in the mono/hairline/single-accent
grammar that `8a`, `9a` and `10a`–`10c` all share, it carries the same header and tab
bar, and turn 10 describes its detail screens as keeping "Today's grammar". Worth
confirming, since it's the one place the handoff's prose and its canvas disagree.

## The gesture animations

`Hand/` is a direct port of the reference renderer, and the capsule tables, pose curves
and camera constants are copied rather than re-derived:

- `HandGeometry.swift` — vector ops, the capsule skeleton (palm, fingers, aimed thumb,
  forearm, ring), and the `pulse` / `hold` easing pair.
- `HandGestures.swift` — the four archetypes with their own camera rigs and pose curves,
  plus cycle durations.
- `HandRenderer.swift` — perspective projection, back-to-front depth sort, and the
  four-pass capsule stroke (ink outline → shadow rim → depth-lit base → inset highlight),
  with the ring's pulsing glow. `GestureTile` drives it from `TimelineView(.animation)`.

Verified by rasterising each gesture at several cycle phases and checking the result
against the design's written description of each shot — side profile for flick up/down,
above-and-behind for left/right, palm-on for snap, stacked mirrored hands for clap.

One behavioural difference from the HTML: SwiftUI's `Canvas` doesn't clip to its bounds
the way `<canvas>` does, so `GestureTile` clips explicitly. Without it the forearm on the
profile shots spills across the neighbouring cell.

## Chart geometry

The design's CSS positions the average/goal rules against the whole chart block, but the
percentages only line up with the data when read against the **plot area**: the steps
average at 40% from the top matches the 59.8% mean bar height, and the heart-rate average
at 53% matches the mean of the resting dots. Both only work plot-relative, so that's how
`MetricCharts.swift` places them — otherwise the "average" line wouldn't sit on the
average.

`HealthData.swift` holds the design's exact numbers for the range each screen opens in
(sleep W, heart rate M, steps 6M). The other ranges are generated from a seeded PRNG in
the same shape, so the picker genuinely re-aggregates and re-animates (200ms ease-out)
rather than being decorative, and the series stay stable across launches.

## Other deviations, all deliberate

- **Fonts.** JetBrains Mono and Instrument Serif aren't bundled; per the handoff these
  resolve to `.monospaced` (SF Mono) and `.serif` (New York). Drop the real faces into
  the target and point `Font.mono` / `Font.serif` at them to close the gap.
- **Safe area.** The 62pt top padding is replaced by the real safe area plus 4pt, and the
  tab bar sits above the home indicator instead of the design's flat 24pt.
- **Tap targets.** The `‹ TODAY` back control is a 44pt target with the label on the
  design's baseline, which puts the headline ~3pt below where the canvas has it.
- **Sleep legend.** In `5a` the stage legend fades in on hover. There's no hover on
  phone, so it's always visible.
- **Grid rules.** Only the left column draws a vertical hairline; the design's CSS puts a
  `border-right` on every cell, which would leave a stray 1px line on the screen edge.

## Not verified

Xcode isn't installed on this machine (Command Line Tools only), so **the app has not
been compiled for iOS or run in a simulator**. What was verified: every source file
type-checks with `swiftc -typecheck` against the macOS SDK, and the screens and gesture
tiles were rasterised through `ImageRenderer` at 393×852 and checked against the canvas.
The `.xcodeproj` is hand-written using Xcode 16 synchronized folder groups (so it needs
no per-file bookkeeping), but it has not been opened by Xcode — expect to confirm the
bundle id and signing team on first run.
